		<p>Hi, my name is Michael (he/him). I am a computer science major, a linguistics minor, and I have a cluster in gender, sexuality, and women's studies. The clubs I am a part of are Off Broadway on Campus (OBOC) and No Jackets Required (NJR). I am the Open Mic and Jam Night Coordinator on the executive board of  NJR. I have some basic experience with writing since I took a short story class in high school, and completed the required undergraduate first year writing course (WRT105). I have a good amount of programming skills. Prior CSC courses: 170, 171, 172, 173, 242, 247, 250.</p>
