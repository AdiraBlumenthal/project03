			<h2>Interests</h2>
				<h3>The Arts</h3>
					<h4>Art</h4>
						<p>I've always had great interest in art and design. One of my favorite things to do is go to museums and galleries. To keep my interest in art alive, I took a course on printmaking last semester. This was the first time I did printmaking, and it was a lot of fun. This piece was inspired by M.C. Escher's work. This type of pattern is called a tessellation. Linoleum blocks were carved, inked, and pressed onto the paper. This technique is called relief printing.</p>

				<h3>Music</h3>
					<p>I've always been in close proximity to music, mainly due to my dad's career in the musical world. I most closely relate to rock music and the electric guitar, having listened to various rock genres and bands since I was young. I most fondly recall listening to Jimi Hendrix in my dad's car. At the time, I had no regard for what I was listening to, but as I grew up I developed a great appreciation for Hendrix and music in general.</p>
					<p>Now, I'm always with a guitar, practicing on the daily. I play in the Rock Ensemble at school, take Jazz guitar lessons at the Eastman School of Music, and have begun recording and mixing my guitar playing. I hope to begin writing my own songs one day.</p>

Story: We named our cat after Haku from the film because we thought he had blue eyes, just like our cat. Turns out he doesn't... She is a 9 year old Siamese cat, though she will be turning 10 on July 15. She's needy and is sometimes an ass (as cats typically are), but she is quite cute nonetheless."</p>
