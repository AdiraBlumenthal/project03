			<h2>Interests</h2>
				<h3>The Arts</h3>
					<h4>Art</h4>
						<p>Joo Eon has always had great interest in art and design. One of his favorite things to do is go to museums and galleries. To keep his interest in art alive, he took a course on printmaking last semester. This was the first time he did printmaking, and it was a lot of fun. This piece was inspired by M.C. Escher's work. This type of pattern is called a tessellation. Linoleum blocks were carved, inked, and pressed onto the paper. This technique is called relief printing.</p>

				<h3>Music</h3>
					<p>Joo Eon has always been in close proximity to music, mainly due to his dad's career in the musical world. He most closely relates to rock music and the electric guitar, having listened to various rock genres and bands since he was young. He most fondly recalls listening to Jimi Hendrix in his dad's car. At the time, he had no regard for what he was listening to, but as he grew up, he developed a great appreciation for Hendrix and music in general.</p>
					<p>Now, he is always with a guitar, practicing on the daily. He plays in the Rock Ensemble at school, take Jazz guitar lessons at the Eastman School of Music, and have begun recording and mixing my guitar playing. He hopes to begin writing my own songs one day.</p>

She is a 9 year old Siamese cat, though she will be turning 10 on July 15. She's needy and is sometimes an ass (as cats typically are), but she is quite cute nonetheless."</p>
