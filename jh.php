			<h2>Research</h2>
			<p>I currently work with the Dias laboratory group in the University of Rochester. The Dias group uses Diamond Anvil Cells (DACs) to study matter at extreme states. My current work with the group involves using Finite Element Models to study the shapes of the tips of diamonds in DACs in order to optimize for highest possible pressure.</p>
