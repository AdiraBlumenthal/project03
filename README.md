-Activities: on campus, off campus
-Fun facts: favorite things, pets, skills)
-A quote
-Link to the original lab

Choreography:
-The navigation is sorted alphabetically by our last names.
-We sorted by category on our sidepages, and sorted them by relevance. For example, interests is before fun facts because it is more relevant. On each of our subpages, we sorted our form of visual art (theater, figure skating, art) before our auditory art (music). Why? To make each subpage more interesting. We all participate in music, so we put our other form of art first.
