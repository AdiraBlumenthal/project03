London

Michael Bashner, Molly Kilian, Joo Eon Park

Classes and relationships:
-Academics
-Interests: the arts (one visual, one auditory = music)
-Activities
-Fun facts (favorites, pets, skills)
-A quote
-Link to the original lab

Choreography:
-The navigation is sorted alphabetically by our last names.
-We sorted by category on our sidepages, and sorted them by relevance. For example, interests is before fun facts because it is more relevant. On each of our subpages, we sorted our form of visual art (theater, figure skating, art) before our auditory art (music).
